// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let x = 1;

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let total = 0;

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
from 1 to 100
while (x <= 100) {
  total = total + x;
  x++;
}

console.log(`While loop total: ${total}`);

// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
from 1 to 100
total = 0;
for (x = 0; x <=100; x++) {
  total = total + x;

console.log(`for loop total: ${total}`);
